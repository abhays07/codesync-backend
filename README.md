## CodeSync: A Microservices-Based Collaborative Development Platform

**CodeSync** is a high-performance, real-time collaborative IDE platform designed for modern developers. It enables multiple users to co-edit code, manage projects via a virtual file system, execute code in isolated sandboxes, and maintain full version control through cryptographic snapshots. The architecture is built on a distributed microservices model, ensuring high availability, scalability, and fault tolerance.

### Core Architecture & Features

The system is composed of 11 specialized microservices, each handling a specific domain of the platform:

1.  **Identity & Access Management:** Secure authentication and authorization using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
2.  **Real-Time Collaboration:** WebSocket-driven co-editing with live cursor tracking and rotating participant markers.
3.  **Virtual File System (VFS):** Hierarchical file and folder management with recursive project forking and cloning capabilities.
4.  **Isolated Execution Engine:** Sandboxed code execution for Java, Python, and JavaScript using Docker containers with strict CPU/RAM quotas.
5.  **Version Control System:** Git-like snapshots using SHA-256 hashing for data integrity and Myers Diff Algorithm for line-by-line comparisons.
6.  **Omnichannel Notifications:** Instant system alerts via WebSockets and professional HTML email dispatches for project collaboration requests.
7.  **Financial Infrastructure:** Razorpay integration for subscription management and automated billing cycles.

### Technical Stack

#### Backend Frameworks & Tools
* **Java 17:** Primary programming language for core business logic.
* **Spring Boot 3.5.x:** Main framework for microservice development.
* **Spring Cloud (2025.x):** Implementation of Netflix Eureka for Service Discovery and OpenFeign for inter-service communication.
* **Spring Security:** Stateless authentication and role-based access control.

#### Data & Messaging
* **MySQL:** Relational database for persistent storage of user, project, and session metadata.
* **RabbitMQ:** Message broker for asynchronous task distribution (Execution jobs and Email dispatch).
* **Spring Data JPA / Hibernate:** Object-Relational Mapping for database interactions.

#### DevOps & Infrastructure
* **Docker:** Containerization of code execution environments to ensure sandbox isolation.
* **Spring Boot Admin:** Centralized monitoring dashboard for real-time health checks and log management.
* **Maven:** Project management and build tool.

#### Third-Party Integrations
* **Razorpay:** Payment gateway for processing subscriptions.
* **Java Diff Utils:** Implementation of the Myers diff algorithm for version comparisons.
* **Monaco Editor (Frontend):** High-fidelity code editing experience.

### Setup and Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/abhays07/codesync-backend.git
    cd codesync-backend
    ```

2.  **Environment Configuration:**
    Configure the following environment variables in your system or a `.env` file:
    * `DB_HOST`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD`
    * `RAZORPAY_KEY_ID`, `RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET`
    * `EMAIL_USERNAME`, `EMAIL_APP_PASSWORD` (Google App Password)

3.  **Start Infrastructure Services:**
    Ensure MySQL, RabbitMQ, and the Docker Daemon are running.

4.  **Service Startup Sequence:**
    Follow this order to ensure proper registration and discovery:
    1.  `Eureka-Server` (Port 8761)
    2.  `Config-Server` (If applicable)
    3.  `API-Gateway` (Port 8080)
    4.  All business microservices (Auth, Project, File, etc.)
    5.  `Admin-Server` (Port 9090)
